I have started using dynamips quite a bit myself, and have changed to the code
to make it nicer and more robust. Feel free to take this patch and use it
how you like. The patch and resulting code is without warranty. Consider
it beta. Use at your own risk. This is the version I run in my own systems.
I am not the author of dynamips and this is in no way an "official" patch.

Changes tested in c3745 and c7200. Other platforms are largely untested.
Please let me know if it breaks anything. However it should be reasonably
safe.

I dont use the hypervisor, so I cannot verify that I have broken it with
these changes. However I extended hypervisor for the new flags as appropriate
and where it seemed safe. All changes are made in a way that nothing should
break. Let me know if it does.

Changelog:
11th Aug 2010
o AUX port in 3745 now works. The error was with the ns16552 emulation of
  channel 2. Somehow the irq signal was commented out. Put back in. This
  should help the 1700,2600,2691,3600,3725 as well.
o the 16552 did not emulate the latch bit, and so when AUX speed was set the
  high and low byte of the speed was read as a character. But although this is
  a bug you probably never noticed it. Fixed anyway. Also now monitors the
  handshake register as well as the speed/parity/stopbits, but does nothing
  with the information except logging it.
o When you telnet to AUX or CONSOLE, stream was not flushed until data was flowing
  from the router, which left the message hanging. Quick fix is to flush the FILE
  immediately. Additionally TCP_NODELAY was added to see if it would help.
o When telnetting into CON or AUX, and before IAC, telnet mode should be
  VTTY_INPUT_TEXT
o Make clean was not deleting everything

8th Aug 2010
o In c3645 the IOS command "reload" spins the emulator out of control. I
  placed a test in the mips64_mem.c routine to check for an vaddr lookup
  of 0x0, and when this happens I SHUTDOWN the vm.
o The flags suggest you can set the base mac address, but the code only works
  for C7200. I put in the missing code for c3645 (verified to work) and
  put in similar code for the rest (unverified). Most of the code was
  there, so there may have been a good reason for it to be missing...
  This is for the command line only, and I did not extend the hypervisor
  in this case.
o Flags which are meant to work but dont now give an error message saying
  what is wrong, rather than being cryptic. This is specific to platform
  options only.
o I put in a flag for my needs which disables the CTRL control
  code "Ctrl-]" to access the monitor console of the vm. It is
  called "--noctrl"
o I put in a flag for my needs which disables the "Connected to" message
  when you telnet to AUX or CONSOLE tcp ports. This was messing up
  the perl module Net::Telnet::Cisco. It is called "--notelnetmsg".
o If you telnet to AUX or CONSOLE tcp, then terminate the link, the
  emulator may crash. The problem is the fclose, which closes the
  link between telnet and uart buffer while there is still data to be
  written from the buffer. This results in a SIGPIPE signal and a crash
  when you are running the command from the prompt (from the hypervisor
  I believe the signal is trapped and handled). Patch catches SIGPIPE
  but does nothing more. Solves the problem for me. 
o Someone posted in a forum that having a flag to save the pid of the process
  would be nice. I have no use for that but it was a trivial addition. Flag
  is "--pidfile filename". 
o The author put in code to support mac addresses in xxxx.xxxx.xxxx and
  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx notation. However if the second format is used
  it is parsed then marked incorrectly as an error. Fixed.

  JatTee found a bug. sizeof should be on struct not pointer to struct.
  It is a simple fix and his patch looks fine.

Bugs I have noticed but cannot yet fix:
o None

Notes you may find useful:

 o Compiling on my x64 machine needed me to change Makefile from:
    LIBS=-L/usr/lib -L. -ldl /usr/lib/libelf.a $(PTHREAD_LIBS)
    to
    LIBS=-L/usr/lib -L. -ldl /usr/lib64/libelf.a $(PTHREAD_LIBS)
   This is not in the patch so if needed you have to do this yourself.
 o Remember to edit Makefile for x64. Follow the comments and
   change "DYNAMIPS_ARCH".
 o I suggest combining this patch with idle_pcs-0.2.8-RC1.patch
   You can download this from sourceforge page for dynagui.
   Applying my patch then theirs seems to apply cleanly.
   I did not roll the patches together as I did not want to confuse my changes
   with dynagui.

Please dont email me with requests or dynagen bug reports (unless of course the
bug is caused by my patch). If you want to email
me patches then I will be happy to join them in with mine if they are sensible.

Thanks again to the original authors. Great bit of software!

Dr Gordon Russell.
