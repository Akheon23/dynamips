What's New since v0.2.8-community
=================================

Renamed from Dynamips-community to the original Dynamips.

Fixed issue #11 - nvram:private-config is destroyed when we write nvram:startup-config
Fixed issue #13 - C3745 has an emulated NVRAM that is not continuous, so we can generate an invalid checksum when the config is written
Fixed issue #14 - a file descriptor is leaked every time the config is extracted/read
